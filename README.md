# Quadrotor Modelling, Control, and State Estimation
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a1c7923-8f44-47f4-a9c8-7d688e103cf1)


This repository contains the modeling, control design, and state estimation of a quadrotor UAV using MATLAB and Simulink. The work covers both Linear and Nonlinear models, Optimal Control Strategies, disturbance rejection, robustness under parametr variations, and full-state estimation with Kalman Filter (Linearised system) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the Nonlinear system.

## ✈️ Project Highlights
- Full 6-DOF **nonlinear quadrotor dynamics** implemented in Simulink and MATLAB Function blocks.
- **Aerodynamic drag** effects included in the model.
- **Linearization** of the nonlinear model around hover equilibrium.
- **LQR controller** for stabilization using linearized models.
- **LQR with integral action** to eliminate steady-state errors during trajectory tracking.
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** to estimate the full 12-dimensional state vector from noisy position and angular velocity measurements.
- **3D trajectory tracking** tasks including circular, rectangular, and spiral trajectories.
